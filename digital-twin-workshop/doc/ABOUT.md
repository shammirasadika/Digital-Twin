# About the Digital Twin RAG System

This project implements a professional Digital Twin using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The backend is built in Python and leverages:


- **Upstash Vector** for vector database and semantic search
- **Groq AI** for ultra-fast LLM inference
- **Professional profile data** structured using the STAR methodology

The system loads your professional data, generates vector embeddings, and stores them in Upstash. When a query is received, it performs semantic search to retrieve relevant information and uses Groq AI to generate a personalized response in real time. All interactions are optimized for recruiter and hiring team scenarios.
